Machine Learning model to predict house price using linear regression.

**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

**Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple yet effective House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. The goal is to predict the price of houses based on various input features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

**Getting Started**
To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
You can install these libraries using pip:
           code - pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
           
**Dataset**
For this project, we have used a dataset containing information about various houses. The dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and the actual sale prices.

**Usage**
You can use the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository to run the code step-by-step and understand how the Linear Regression model predicts house prices.
            code - jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
            
**Model Training**
The core of this project is the Linear Regression model. You can find the code for model training in the Jupyter Notebook. You can customize and fine-tune the model as needed.

**Evaluation**
We have included evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score to assess the model's performance. These metrics are explained in the Jupyter Notebook.

**Results**
The project provides insights into how well the Linear Regression model predicts house prices based on the given features. You can visualize the results and understand the relationships between input features and predicted prices.
